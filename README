**Translator for KDE KRunner (Plasma 5)**

Well, it's a translator and it translates text using various apis.

Syntax: <sourcelang>-<targetlang> <searchterm>

A list of all language codes you can find here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
ISO 639-1 as well as ISO 639-3 should work!


Example: en-de house

this will translate "house" into german (de)

Example: fra-eng maison

this will translate the french word "maison" into english

Simple, isn't it? :-)
